Hey! I'm third year ICT Engineering student studying at [JAMK](https://www.jamk.fi/en). I'm ambitious and fast learner and I love to do things properly and well. I'm currently most interested at devops, programming and project management. My favorite programming language is currently C#. The cutting edge of technology is what fascinates me most and I'm trying to stay and keep on the edge of knowledge as well. Never know if I'm ending up putting up a business by myself at some point :wink:.
