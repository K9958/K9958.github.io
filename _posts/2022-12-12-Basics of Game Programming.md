-	Using ready-made prefabs and using them via scripts
-	Using ready-made sounds and music, and managing them via scripts
-	Using different Unity Packages such as Cinemachine, Input System, Mecanim, Particle Pack
-	Using Navigation mesh and Navigation mesh agents

    - player movement and jump
    - item pickup and inventory system
    - Creating and managing a GUI (item hotbar, health)
